This project provides a series of Flutter examples using the **Provider** state management library.  
Continuously updating...  

### Included Examples  

1. **Counter App**  
   - Basic `Provider` usage example  
   - Demonstrates how to manage a simple counter state  

2. **Shopping Cart**  
   - Implements a multi-user shopping cart using `ProxyProvider`  
   - Supports user login, product addition, and cart cleanup upon logout  

### Dependency Notes  
All examples are based on:  
- `provider`  
- Other necessary dependencies (e.g., `http` for network request examples)  

### Learning Objectives  
- Understand the use cases of `Provider` and its variants (`ChangeNotifierProvider`, `FutureProvider`, etc.)  
- Master core concepts of state management (e.g., dependency injection, state sharing)  
- Learn to manage state hierarchically in complex applications (e.g., global state vs. local state)
